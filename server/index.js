Required messages to be received and handled by the server:
playerTappedBoard - after checking whether the column and row are valid moves to be made, 
send back valid or invalid as strings to signifiy whether the move was valid or not.
findPlayer - the server will search all currently connected clients to the client that 
request this. this will be an emitWithAck message rather than regular emit. this way, 
after the server emits, it can expect the client to send back an ack message containing 
the id of the player they want to play with.

Required messages for the server to send to the client.
connect - send back id for player to identify with, this can be just a number. 
gameStart - send back to each client participating in the game the size of the gameboard,
 as well as the position of each playerâ€™s ship on the gameboard.
